## About me

I am a postdoc at the University of Cambridge mentored by [Yang Li](https://sites.google.com/view/yanglimaths/home) since September 2025.
I am broadly interested in geometric analysis and geometric variational problems, in particular those at the interface with other fields like symplectic geometry and, more recently, gauge theory.

I completed my PhD in 2025 at ETH Zürich with [Tristan Rivière](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~triviere/). Previously I was a Master's student at the University of Cambridge (Part III), and I did my Bachelor's thesis under [Javier Gómez-Serrano](https://sites.brown.edu/jgs/) as a visitor in Princeton.

In my PhD I investigated the regularity theory of critical points of the area functional restricted to Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds, and the possible structure of their singularities.

## Teaching

In Lent term 2026 I am teaching the Part III course on Elliptic Partial Differential Equations, together with [André Guerra](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~adblg2/).
